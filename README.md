# Covid-19-Vaccination-Analysis
In Spring 2021, my partner and I analyzed COVID-19 vaccination efforts of various countries with a focus on the United States using Python, specifically the Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, and Facebook Prophet libraries. We explored three research questions based on already collected COVID-19 vaccination data:
1) Which countries are leading in vaccination rates?
2) How well is the United States doing in their vaccination efforts?
3) Based on the current vaccination rates, when will the United States population be vaccinated (at least one dose)?

To predict when the United States population will be vaccinated, we utilized a Facebook Prophet time series model. We produced bar graphs, line graphs, choropleth maps, and time series graphs to display our findings.
